# Grid

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for websites and applications, allowing for the creation of rows and columns to arrange elements on a page.
It provides a robust way to structure web content, making it easier to lay out and align elements, and it provides powerful responsive design capabilities by allowing elements to span multiple rows and columns, or adjust in size based on the available space.
CSS Grid is fully supported by modern browsers and is widely used in front-end web development to create flexible and dynamicÂ layouts.
